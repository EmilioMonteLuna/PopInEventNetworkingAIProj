# LinkedIn API Requirements for PopIn Team

**Project**: Event Networking AI System  
**Developer**: Emilio Montelongo Luna  
**Company**: LetsPopIn.com  

## 📋 Overview

The Event Networking AI System has been developed with complete LinkedIn API integration capabilities. To activate this feature, the PopIn team needs to set up a LinkedIn Developer Application under the company's account.

## 🎯 What's Already Built

✅ **Complete LinkedIn OAuth Integration**  
✅ **Automatic Profile Import System**  
✅ **User Matching Enhancement**  
✅ **API Endpoints for LinkedIn Data**  
✅ **Security & Error Handling**  

**The technical implementation is 100% complete - we just need PopIn's LinkedIn App credentials.**

## 🏢 Action Required from PopIn Team

### **Step 1: Create LinkedIn Developer Application**

**Who**: PopIn's marketing/business development team  
**Where**: [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/)  
**Account**: Use PopIn's official LinkedIn company account

### **Step 2: App Configuration**

**App Details Needed:**
- **App Name**: `PopIn Event Networking` (or similar)
- **LinkedIn Page**: PopIn's official LinkedIn company page
- **Privacy Policy URL**: PopIn's privacy policy
- **App Logo**: PopIn's logo/branding

**Required OAuth Scopes:**
- `r_liteprofile` - Basic profile information
- `r_emailaddress` - Email address access

**Redirect URLs to Add:**
- Development: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/linkedin/callback`
- Production: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/linkedin/callback`

### **Step 3: Provide Credentials**

**What PopIn Needs to Share with Developer:**
- **Client ID** (public identifier)
- **Client Secret** (private - handle securely)

**How to Share Securely:**
- Use encrypted communication
- Consider using a password manager
- DO NOT share via email/Slack in plain text

## 🔒 Security & Compliance Considerations

### **Data Handling**
- LinkedIn profile data will be stored in PopIn's database
- Used only for event networking recommendations
- Users explicitly consent via LinkedIn OAuth flow
- Data can be deleted upon user request

### **Privacy Policy Requirements**
PopIn's privacy policy should include:
- LinkedIn data collection and usage
- Data retention policies
- User rights and deletion procedures
- Contact information for data requests

### **Terms of Service**
- Compliance with LinkedIn's API Terms
- Clear user consent for data processing
- Right to revoke LinkedIn access

## 🎛️ System Configuration

Once PopIn provides credentials, the developer will:

1. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI=your_production_domain/api/v1/linkedin/callback
   ```

2. **Deploy with LinkedIn Integration Active**

3. **Test the Complete OAuth Flow**
